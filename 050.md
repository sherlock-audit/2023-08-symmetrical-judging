# Upgradeable stablecoins like TUSD as collateral token whose future risks are unknown can break the protocol
## Summary
The protocol makes use of stablecoins and accepts the risks associated with these. However its likely they accept the risks that are currently known and expected to prevail given most stablecoins don't change. However stablecoins like TUSD can be upgraded. 

## Vulnerability Detail
[Collateral Token](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/storages/GlobalAppStorage.sol#L14)
Stablecoins with code and logic that can be changed in future in unexpected ways can cause the protocol to break. Additionally it may lead to users collateral being locked 

## Impact 
TUSD is an upgradeable stablecoin with a proxy and implementation contract. The implementation contract can be upgraded anytime in the future in ways that lead to logic, features or implementations that can break the protocol as these new aspects where not anticipated. 

New implementation can block, blacklist the protocol or users, change token balances, change how it handles return values, rebase, limit transfers to certain amounts only, require KYC or whitelisted users, follow a different token standard e.g in unexpected  ways such that SafeERC20.safeTransfer and SafeERC20.safeTransfer  wont work,  or some other features that may unexpectedly break current working protocol affecting e.g deposits, withdraws or collaterals being locked etc 

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function deposit(address user, uint256 amount) internal {
        GlobalAppStorage.Layout storage appLayout = GlobalAppStorage.layout();
        IERC20(appLayout.collateral).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
        uint256 amountWith18Decimals = (amount * 1e18) /
        (10 ** IERC20Metadata(appLayout.collateral).decimals());
        AccountStorage.layout().balances[user] += amountWith18Decimals;
    }
   function withdraw(address user, uint256 amount) internal {
        AccountStorage.Layout storage accountLayout = AccountStorage.layout();
        GlobalAppStorage.Layout storage appLayout = GlobalAppStorage.layout();
        require(
            block.timestamp >=
            accountLayout.withdrawCooldown[msg.sender] + MAStorage.layout().deallocateCooldown,
            "AccountFacet: Cooldown hasn't reached"
        );
        uint256 amountWith18Decimals = (amount * 1e18) /
        (10 ** IERC20Metadata(appLayout.collateral).decimals());
        accountLayout.balances[msg.sender] -= amountWith18Decimals;
        IERC20(appLayout.collateral).safeTransfer(user, amount);
    }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider a whitelist to avoid such stablecoin tokens
Consider emergency, upgradeability, plausibility controls specific to such tokens in the event they change
