# PartyAFacetImpl::sendQuote() - L41: Should < not be changed to <= for `maLayout.pendingQuotesValidLength`, since the name implies a max valid length, not so?
## Summary
PartyAFacetImpl::sendQuote() - L41: Should < not be changed to <= for `maLayout.pendingQuotesValidLength`, since the name implies a max valid length, not so?

## Vulnerability Detail
n/a

## Impact
(Probably LOW, but decided to report this anyway in case I'm right, then at least the protocol team should be informed.)

Number of pending quotes could still be within range, IF `maLayout.pendingQuotesValidLength` is a valid max value for the range, but will revert the the sendQuote() call.

## Code Snippet

Existing code:
```Solidity
        require(
            quoteLayout.partyAPendingQuotes[msg.sender].length < maLayout.pendingQuotesValidLength, /// @audit LOW: should this not be <= ?
            "PartyAFacet: Number of pending quotes out of range"
        );
```

## Tool used
VSC.
Manual Review

## Recommendation

Suggest to change to, IF above assumption is correct:
```Solidity   
quoteLayout.partyAPendingQuotes[msg.sender].length <= maLayout.pendingQuotesValidLength,
```
