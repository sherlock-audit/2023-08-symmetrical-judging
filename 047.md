# Deployment issues with chains not compatible with Shanghai hardfork
## Summary
Project uses Solidity versions >=0.8.18 so may make use of 0.8.20 which may produce incompatible bytecode with some chains

## Vulnerability Detail
Shanghai hard from now the default EVM version in compiler introduced PUSH0 opcode  not yet supported on some chains such as Arbitrum 
[Solidity version may use 0.8.20](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/Account/AccountFacetImpl.sol#L5C1-L5C26)

## Impact
Besides issues with deployment &maintenance contracts;  A Big Issues is quoted below from an audit finding...
"This could also become a problem if different versions of Solidity are used to compile contracts for different chains. The differences in bytecode between versions can impact the deterministic nature of contract addresses, potentially breaking counterfactuality". - See example audit finding 
[Project may fail to be deployed to chains not compatible with Shanghai hardfork](https://solodit.xyz/issues/m-04-project-may-fail-to-be-deployed-to-chains-not-compatible-with-shanghai-hardfork-code4rena-ambire-ambire-wallet-invitational-git)

## Code Snippet
```solidity 
pragma solidity >=0.8.18;
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to fix the Solidity version to 0.8.18 or 0.8.19
```solidity 
pragma solidity 0.8.19;
```
