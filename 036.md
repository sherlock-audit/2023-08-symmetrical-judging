# Party B's liquidation can be stuck if the signature is not created within the liquidation timeout period
## Summary

The liquidation of Party B can get stuck if the signature (`priceSig`) is not created within the liquidation timeout period (`maLayout.liquidationTimeout`).

## Vulnerability Detail

In [Issue 293](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical-judging/issues/293), it was mentioned that the require statement at Line 327 below will result in the liquidation of PartyB being stuck.

However, it was found that the require statement that is causing the issue still exists in the updated codebase. Thus, this issue is not remediated.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacetImpl.sol#L328

```solidity
File: LiquidationFacetImpl.sol
317:     function liquidatePositionsPartyB(
318:         address partyB,
319:         address partyA,
320:         QuotePriceSig memory priceSig
321:     ) internal {
322:         AccountStorage.Layout storage accountLayout = AccountStorage.layout();
323:         MAStorage.Layout storage maLayout = MAStorage.layout();
324:         QuoteStorage.Layout storage quoteLayout = QuoteStorage.layout();
325: 
326:         LibMuon.verifyQuotePrices(priceSig);
327: @>      require(
328: @>           priceSig.timestamp <=
329: @>               maLayout.partyBLiquidationTimestamp[partyB][partyA] + maLayout.liquidationTimeout,
330: @>           "LiquidationFacet: Invalid signature"
331: @>      );
332:         require(
333:             maLayout.partyBLiquidationStatus[partyB][partyA],
334:             "LiquidationFacet: PartyB is solvent"
335:         );
336:         require(
337:             maLayout.partyBLiquidationTimestamp[partyB][partyA] <= priceSig.timestamp,
338:             "LiquidationFacet: Expired signature"
339:         );
```

Further inspection of the above require statements shows that the `priceSig.timestamp` must satisfy the following constraint. 

```solidity
maLayout.partyBLiquidationTimestamp[partyB][partyA] <= priceSig.timestamp <=  maLayout.partyBLiquidationTimestamp[partyB][partyA] + maLayout.liquidationTimeout
```

The `maLayout.partyBLiquidationTimestamp[partyB][partyA]` was set to the `upnlSig.timestamp` (SingleUpnlSig) within the `liquidatePartyB` function. Thus, the following constraint exists:

```solidity
upnlSig.timestamp <= priceSig.timestamp <=  upnlSig.timestamp + maLayout.liquidationTimeout
```

To be exact, the liquidation process will be stuck in the following scenario:

- The liquidator did not generate the `priceSig` within `maLayout.liquidationTimeout` after the `upnlSig.timestamp` (Intentionally or Accidentally)

Without a `priceSig` with a timestamp that satisfies the above constraint, there is no way to call the `liquidatePositionsPartyB` function without encountering a revert.

## Impact

Liquidation of PartyB will be stuck. Medium impact as per the original [report](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical-judging/issues/293).

## Recommendation

Consider adding functionality to reset the liquidation status of Party B once the liquidation timeout is reached as per the recommendation in the original report.
