# Critical Smart Contract Underflow Allows Unauthorized Fund Withdrawals
## Summary
This report highlights a vulnerability in the withdraw function of a smart contract. The vulnerability can potentially lead to an underflow issue, allowing users to withdraw more than their balance.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the withdraw function, there is a missing check that could lead to an underflow situation. The vulnerable code is as follows:

    uint256 amountWith18Decimals = (amount * 1e18) /
    (10 ** IERC20Metadata(appLayout.collateral).decimals());
    accountLayout.balances[msg.sender] -= amountWith18Decimals;

The code calculates the amountWith18Decimals based on the user's withdrawal amount and token decimals, and then subtracts this value from the user's balance without verifying if the user has sufficient funds.
  mapping(address => uint256) balances as stated in  AccountStorage.sol 
accountLayout.balances[msg.sender]  will underflow

also as it s called in AccountFacet, there s no check for the required amount to be less than thz user's balance

    function withdraw(uint256 amount) external whenNotAccountingPaused notSuspended(msg.sender) {
        AccountFacetImpl.withdraw(msg.sender, amount);
        emit Withdraw(msg.sender, msg.sender, amount);
    }

## Impact
If a user attempts to withdraw an amount that exceeds their current balance, the vulnerable withdraw function will allow the transaction to proceed, resulting in a negative balance for the user. This will lead to financial losses as their accountLayout.balances would be a very large number allowing them to withdraw all the contract's fund .

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
add a require statement to check if the user's balance is sufficient before deducting the amountWith18Decimals from their balance.
