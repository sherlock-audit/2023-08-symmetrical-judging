# ControlFacet.sol#setSymbolTradingFee() - Possibility to set an arbitrary trading fee without any restriction
## Summary
The owner can set an abusive trading fee using **`setSymbolTradingFee()`**
## Vulnerability Detail
In the **`ControlFacet.sol`** contract, the protocol's characteristics are configured, including the addition of different tokens via the **`addSymbol()`** function. This function takes a **`tradingFee`** parameter, which is used to set the trading fees for the tokens. To prevent abusive fees, a **`require(tradingFee <= 1e18, "ControlFacet: High trading fee")`** statement is included.
```Solidity
require(tradingFee <= 1e18, "ControlFacet: High trading fee")
```
However, the issue arises with the **`setSymbolTradingFee()`** function, which allows the owner to change trading fees for existing tokens. In this case, the absence of a require statement permits arbitrary trading fees to be set.
```Solidity
function setSymbolTradingFee(   
        uint256 symbolId,
        uint256 tradingFee
    ) external onlyRole(LibAccessibility.SYMBOL_MANAGER_ROLE) {
        SymbolStorage.Layout storage symbolLayout = SymbolStorage.layout();
        require(symbolId >= 1 && symbolId <= symbolLayout.lastId, "ControlFacet: Invalid id");
        emit SetSymbolTradingFee(symbolId, symbolLayout.symbols[symbolId].tradingFee, tradingFee);
        symbolLayout.symbols[symbolId].tradingFee = tradingFee;
    }
```
## Impact
Possibility of deducting an abusive trading fees causing a loss of funds for users.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add in **`setSymbolTradingFee()`**  a **`require(tradingFee <= 1e18, "ControlFacet: High trading fee")`** like in the **`addSymbol()`** .
