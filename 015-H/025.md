# Protocol assumes 18 decimals collateral
## Summary
This report identifies a calculation issue in the deposit function of a smart contract. The problem arises from assuming a fixed number of decimal places (18) for all collateral tokens , leading to incorrect calculations when interacting with tokens that have a different number of decimals.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the deposit function, the code calculates amountWith18Decimals by multiplying the amount by 1e18 and dividing by 10 raised to the power of the token's decimals. However, this calculation assumes that all tokens have 18 decimals, which may not be the case for some tokens. Here's the problematic code snippet:

    uint256 amountWith18Decimals = (amount * 1e18) / (10 ** IERC20Metadata(appLayout.collateral).decimals());


## Impact
The impact of this issue is significant, especially when interacting with tokens that have a different number of decimals.
 amountWith18Decimals would be bigger in case of vollateral being usdc, wich it s decimals s 1e6, and low for  YAMv2 that  has 24 decimals.

As this s implemented in deposit and withdraw, and called in the external functions of AccountFacet, in deposit, depositFor, withdraw, withdrawto, this will lead to inaccurate collateral ratio calculations, leading to loss of funds to users and  excess token withdrawals to others .

        (10 ** IERC20Metadata(appLayout.collateral).decimals());

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
 determine the number of decimals of the collateral token  and use it in the calculation of amountWith18Decimals.
