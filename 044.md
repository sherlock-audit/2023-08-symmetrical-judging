# Proxy accounts lack functionalities to act as party A
## Summary
Proxy accounts lack functionalities to act as party A.
## Vulnerability Detail
Functionalities for proxy accounts to act as party A is very limited. For example, users could not directly allocate funds or open a quote. It seems like 'multi account' feature is unusable as party A.
## Impact
Users who deposit funds into proxy account (as party A) will have no way to use their money. They cannot interact directly with their proxy account as party A because _call() only accepts calls from multi account contract.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add trusted role (similar to proxy party B's implementation) so that users can interact with their proxy account as party A.
