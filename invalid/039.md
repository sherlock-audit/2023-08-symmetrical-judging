# Party B can still postpone force close
## Summary
Party B can still postpone force close by opening a small part of the quote request.
## Vulnerability Detail
In readme PR #13 states:
> Problem with PartyB Postponing Force Close
> 
> This update fixes a problem where partyB could delay a force close by closing a small part of the request and updating the modifyTimestamp field. The field name is now changed to statusModifyTimestamp and, as the name suggests, it only changes when the quote status changes.

However the problem is not fixed, for the statusModifyTimestamp still gets updated when userB open a position.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. Remove this line:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/PartyB/PartyBFacetImpl.sol#L130
2. Add a new field 'forceCloseDeadline' to the struct Quote. Use this instead of lastStatusModifyTimeStamp when force close
3. Implement a map (address userAddress -> uint openedPositionTimeStamp) to check if users have opened parts of the quote before. If yes then forceCloseDeadline  = openedPositionTimeStamp, otherwise forceCloseDeadline  = block.timestamp.
