# If PartyB misses any funding window, it is unable to charge/pay funding fee for this period
## Summary

The way funding is implemented, partyB has to call `chargeFundngRate` in every epoch (window) of `block.timestamp` between [`epochDuration - windowTime`; `epochDuration + windowTime`]. Any time partyB misses to call `chargeFundingRate` in this window, funding is not charged for the epoch and thus either partyB or partyA losses funds due to this. Since partyB can miss to call `chargeFundingRate` for various reasons, and also to save on gas fees, it should be possible to charge funding for all previous epochs, not just 1 single epoch.

## Vulnerability Detail

The epoch chosen to charge funding is based on current `block.timestamp`:
```solidity
    uint256 latestEpochTimestamp = (block.timestamp / epochDuration) * epochDuration;
    uint256 paidTimestamp;
    if (block.timestamp <= latestEpochTimestamp + windowTime) {
        require(
            latestEpochTimestamp > quote.lastFundingPaymentTimestamp,
            "PartyBFacet: Funding already paid for this window"
        );
        paidTimestamp = latestEpochTimestamp;
    } else {
        uint256 nextEpochTimestamp = latestEpochTimestamp + epochDuration;
        require(
            block.timestamp >= nextEpochTimestamp - windowTime,
            "PartyBFacet: Current timestamp is out of window"
        );
        require(
            nextEpochTimestamp > quote.lastFundingPaymentTimestamp,
            "PartyBFacet: Funding already paid for this window"
        );
        paidTimestamp = nextEpochTimestamp;
    }
```

The funding is charged by modifying `quote.openedPrice`, using rate for 1 epoch:
```solidity
    uint256 priceDiff = (quote.openedPrice * uint256(rates[i])) / 1e18;
    if (quote.positionType == PositionType.LONG) {
        quote.openedPrice += priceDiff;
    } else {
        quote.openedPrice -= priceDiff;
    }
```

Any epoch missed by partyB will make it impossible to charge funding for expired but not charged epochs.

## Impact

Loss of funds for partyB or partyA as due to funding not received for epochs partyB missed to call charge funding for.

## Code Snippet

Funding is charged only for 1 epoch, and timestamp of last paid epoch is set to it (to prevent charging for any previous epochs):

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Calculate number of epochs between the previous charged epoch and current one and charge `(1 + rate) ^ number_of_epochs - 1` for all epochs. This will allow to apply funding for all epochs regardless of when partyB calls the function to charge it, and also save on gas fees as partyB doesn't have to charge funding every epoch.
