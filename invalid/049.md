# Single step change of ownership
## Summary
Contracts make use of an owner/ access controlled roles that can be changed in a risky single step 

## Vulnerability Detail
[LibDiamond.sol contracts have a single step to transfer ownership](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/libraries/LibDiamond.sol#L40)
This is done without checks if new owner still has control or access of the account. If ownership is transferred to account without access it is lost or could go into the hand of malicious owner 

[ControlFacet.sol makes use of this Ownable access  control functionality](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/control/ControlFacet.sol#L16)

## Impact
ControlFacet can be left without owner responsible for critical functions like initializing and setting admin or malicious entity who gets access due to error or otherwise can now control admin and initialization aspects of contract 

## Code Snippet

```solidity 
function setContractOwner(address _newOwner) internal {
        DiamondStorage storage ds = diamondStorage();
        address previousOwner = ds.contractOwner;
        ds.contractOwner = _newOwner;
        emit OwnershipTransferred(previousOwner, _newOwner);
    }

function setAdmin(address user) external onlyOwner {
        GlobalAppStorage.layout().hasRole[user][LibAccessibility.DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE] = true;
        emit RoleGranted(LibAccessibility.DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, user);
    }



```
## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to make use of 2 step transfer of ownership process where ownership is set and claimed by right address. It is best practise to either follow the OpenZeppling Ownable2Step implementation or to actually use their Ownable2Step implementation
