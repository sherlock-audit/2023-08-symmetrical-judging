# Unauthorized Token Transfer due to Misplaced safeApprove
## Summary 
the contract  transfers tokens from `msg.sender` to itself using `IERC20Upgradeable(collateral).safeTransferFrom.` Subsequently, it approves the `symmioAddress` contract to spend the same amount using IERC20Upgradeable(collateral).safeApprove(symmioAddress, amount).
The problem is between the line  1 and 3, any external contract or malicious actor modifies the approval state of the contract's token allowance for symmioAddress. Can lead to unintended transfers or manipulation of tokens

## Vulnerability Detail
See summary 
```solidity
function depositForAccount(
        address account,
        uint256 amount
    ) external onlyOwner(account, msg.sender) whenNotPaused {
        address collateral = ISymmio(symmioAddress).getCollateral();
        IERC20Upgradeable(collateral).safeTransferFrom(
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            amount
        );
        IERC20Upgradeable(collateral).safeApprove(symmioAddress, amount);
        ISymmio(symmioAddress).depositFor(account, amount);
        emit DepositForAccount(msg.sender, account, amount);
    }
```
The problem is between the line  1 and 3, Can lead to unintended transfers or manipulation of tokens.

## Impact
The issue can result in tokens trapped within the contract or potentially transferred to unintended addresses, leading to financial losses or disruptions in the token flow.

## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
Is better to reversing the order of operations as follow : 
```solidity
function depositForAccount(
    address account,
    uint256 amount
) external onlyOwner(account, msg.sender) whenNotPaused {
    address collateral = ISymmio(symmioAddress).getCollateral();
    IERC20Upgradeable(collateral).safeApprove(symmioAddress, amount); // Approve first
    IERC20Upgradeable(collateral).safeTransferFrom(
        msg.sender,
        address(this),
        amount
    );
    ISymmio(symmioAddress).depositFor(account, amount);
    emit DepositForAccount(msg.sender, account, amount);
}
```
By approving symmioAddress to spend amount first, this ensure that the allowance is set correctly before transferring tokens from msg.sender to the contract and  minimizes the risk of unauthorized token transfers or manipulation.
