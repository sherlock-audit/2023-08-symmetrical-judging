# User deposited collateral can get stuck in the AccountStorage
## Summary
It's possible to call `AccountFacet.depositFor` for a zero address.

## Vulnerability Detail
1. User can call  `depositFor` on a zero address. 
2. The funds will be transferred to the AccountStorage from `msg.sender` and balance recorded for `address(0)`.
3. There's not way to undo this with `withdraw` or `withdrawTo` because `address(0)` cannot  receive the collateral. 

```solidity
// From AccountFacet.sol
function depositFor(address user, uint256 amount) external whenNotAccountingPaused {
        AccountFacetImpl.deposit(user, amount);
        emit Deposit(msg.sender, user, amount);
}

// From Library AccountFacetImpl.sol
function deposit(address user, uint256 amount) internal {
        GlobalAppStorage.Layout storage appLayout = GlobalAppStorage.layout();
        IERC20(appLayout.collateral).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
        uint256 amountWith18Decimals = (amount * 1e18) /
        (10 ** IERC20Metadata(appLayout.collateral).decimals());
>>        AccountStorage.layout().balances[user] += amountWith18Decimals; // balances[address(0)] += amountWith18Decimals
}
```

## Impact
A user can mistakenly send deposit for a zero address and have no way of withdrawing it. 
The collateral will be stuck in the AccountStorage.

## Recommendation
Add a zero address require check to prevent deposits for zero addresses.
```solidity
function depositFor(address user, uint256 amount) external whenNotAccountingPaused {
        require(user != address(0), "AccountFacet: Zero address");
        AccountFacetImpl.deposit(user, amount);
        emit Deposit(msg.sender, user, amount);
}
```
