# amount is not converted into correct decimal before allocating in depositAndAllocateForAccount()
## Summary
Amount is not converted into correct decimal before allocating in depositAndAllocateForAccount().
## Vulnerability Detail
Because  account's balance is stored as 18 decimals, deposited amount should be converted into 18 decimals before allocating as well. This will result in users only allocating a fraction of balance on their 'proxy' accounts.
## Impact
Users can only allocate a fraction of their money to their proxy accounts, and there is no way to fully allocate their money.
