# Missing Implementation for pause functionalities in SymmioPartyB
## Summary
`SymmioPartyB` contract does not implement the pause/unpause function, which leads to the `whenNotPause` modifier being useless. 

## Vulnerability Detail
`SymmioPartyB` contract is inherited from `PausableUpgradeable` contract and actively uses `whenNotPaused` in the following functions:
-  `_approve`
-  `_call`

However, corresponding pause and unpause are not implemented in the current codebase. As a result, the value for `_pause` cannot be changed, which leads to the functionality missing.
 
## Impact
Pause functionality will be missing, `_approve` and `_call` functions cannot be paused

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/multiAccount/SymmioPartyB.sol#L14
```solidity
contract SymmioPartyB is
    Initializable,
    PausableUpgradeable,
    AccessControlUpgradeable
{...}

function _approve(address token, uint256 amount)
    external
    onlyRole(TRUSTED_ROLE)
    whenNotPaused
{
    require(
        IERC20Upgradeable(token).approve(symmioAddress, amount),
        "SymmioPartyB: Not approved"
    );
}

function _call(bytes[] calldata _callDatas)
    external
    onlyRole(TRUSTED_ROLE)
    whenNotPaused
{
    for (uint8 i; i < _callDatas.length; i++) {
        (bool _success, ) = symmioAddress.call{value: 0}(_callDatas[i]);
        require(_success, "SymmioPartyB: execution reverted");
    }
}

```
