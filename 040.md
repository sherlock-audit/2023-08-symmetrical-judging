# Party B can still perform some actions after being deregistered
## Summary
Party B can still perform some actions after being deregistered.
## Vulnerability Detail
Some party B core functions dont check if users are still partyB or not. Thus, users can still perform some core actions, such as opening positions, as partyB while they have been already deregistered by admins.
## Impact
It goes against the purpose of being deregistered.
