# Lack of approvals from caller will cause a function to always revert
## Summary
The ```AccountFacet.sol``` smart contract uses the ```AccountFacetImpl.sol``` library to conclude it's functions. however in ```deposit()``` function inside ```AccountFacet.sol``` call the ```deposit()``` impl inside ```AccountFacetImpl.sol`` to transfer funds from the caller to the AccountFacet, the problem with this impl is that it uses ```safeERC20``` ```safeTransferFrom()```  from openzeppelin that will revert if the to param have not been approved to spend the amount of token by the sender.
## Vulnerability Detail
The OpenZeppelin library provides a contract called SafeERC20 that includes a function called safeTransferFrom which allows your contract to safely receive tokens from another address. This function behaves just like the standard transferFrom function in an ERC20 token contract, but it includes additional safety checks to ensure that the transfer doesn't result in unexpected behavior.

Here's how it works:

Approval: Before your contract can use safeTransferFrom to receive tokens from another address, the sender must first approve your contract to spend a certain amount of their tokens. This is done using the standard ERC20 approve function.

Safety Checks: When you call safeTransferFrom in your contract, it checks whether the sender has approved your contract to spend the required amount of tokens. If the approval is missing or insufficient, the safeTransferFrom function will revert, ensuring that the transfer is not made without proper authorization.

Transfer: If the approval is present and sufficient, the safeTransferFrom function will transfer the specified amount of tokens from the sender's address to your contract's address.

This mechanism ensures that tokens are transferred to your contract only when the sender has explicitly granted permission, preventing unauthorized transfers and potential loss of tokens.
## Impact
The underlying impact is a DoS type on the deposit function, because users won't be able to deposit their token
