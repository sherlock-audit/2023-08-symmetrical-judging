# `liquidatePartyA` requires signature which doesn't have nonce, making possible unfair liquidation and loss of funds for all parties
## Summary

`liquidationSig` provided by liquidator to `liquidatePartyA` doesn't have nonces of neither partyA nor partyB. This means that this signature is valid even if partyA and/or partyB do some actions before the liquidation with this signature happens. There are numerous scenarios possible, both happening by itself and caused by malicious parties, where this can lead to loss of funds for some or all parties involved.

## Vulnerability Detail

Example Scenario:

1. PartyA: allocated=109, upnl=-99, cva+lf=10. To avoid liquidation, partyA tries to close 50% of its position, submitting requestToClosePosition
2. PartyA: allocated=109, upnl=-100, cva+lf=10. PartyA becomes liquidatable
3. Liquidator submits liquidating transaction (with upnl=-100), but partyB at the same time fulfills partyA request
3. partyB transaction executes first, partyA has: allocated = 59, upnl=-50, cva+lf=5 (not liquidatable anymore)
4. Liquidator transaction executes (with upnl=-100):
4.1. Available Balance = 59-5 - 100 = -46
4.2. Liquidation type = OVERDUE (46 > 5), deficit = 41
4.3. Corresponding partyB receives 50 - 50*46/100 = 27
4.4. PartyA allocated balance is set to 0
4.5. Liquidators receives 0 (because it's OVERDUE liquidation)

The result: 
1. PartyA was solvent just before the liquidation, but was still liquidated, losing all funds
2. PartyB has received 27 instead of full 50 profit (even though partyA had enough funds)
3. Liquidator didn't receive any fee, although it should have received it as partyA had enough funds.

All 3 parties have lost funds. Protocol basically stole those funds.

## Impact

Unfair liquidation for partyA, loss of funds for liquidator and partyB in many possible situations during partyA liquidation - happening by itself or caused by malicious actors.

## Proof of Concept

Add this to any test, for example to `ClosePosition.behavior.ts`.

```ts
it("PartyA wrong upnl liquidation", async function () {
  const context: RunContext = this.context;

  this.user_allocated = decimal(119);
  this.hedger_allocated = decimal(1000);
  
  this.user = new User(this.context, this.context.signers.user);
  await this.user.setup();
  await this.user.setBalances(this.user_allocated, this.user_allocated, this.user_allocated);

  this.hedger = new Hedger(this.context, this.context.signers.hedger);
  await this.hedger.setup();
  await this.hedger.setBalances(this.hedger_allocated, this.hedger_allocated);

  this.liquidator = new User(this.context, this.context.signers.liquidator);
  await this.liquidator.setup();

  // open position (100 @ 10)
  await this.user.sendQuote(limitQuoteRequestBuilder()
    .positionType(PositionType.LONG)
    .quantity(decimal(100))
    .price(decimal(10))
    .cva(decimal(6)).lf(decimal(4)).mm(decimal(10))
    .build()
  );
  await this.hedger.lockQuote(1, 0, decimal(1));
  await this.hedger.openPosition(1, limitOpenRequestBuilder().filledAmount(decimal(100)).openPrice(decimal(10)).price(decimal(10)).build());

  var info = await this.user.getBalanceInfo();
  console.log("partyA allocated: " + info.allocatedBalances / 1e18 + " locked: " + info.totalLocked/1e18 + " pendingLocked: " + info.totalPendingLocked / 1e18);
  var info = await this.hedger.getBalanceInfo(this.user.getAddress());
  console.log("partyB allocated: " + info.allocatedBalances / 1e18 + " locked: " + info.totalLocked/1e18 + " pendingLocked: " + info.totalPendingLocked / 1e18);

  // price goes to 9, so user is in a loss of -100 (less fee), locked balance = 10, so liquidatable
  // user tries to close half of its position to save liquidation
  //await this.user.setBalances(this.user_allocated, this.user_allocated, this.user_allocated);
  await this.user.requestToClosePosition(
    1,
    limitCloseRequestBuilder().quantityToClose(decimal(50)).closePrice(decimal(9)).build(),
  );

  // liquidators obtains signature to liquidate
  var sig = await getDummyLiquidationSig("0x10", decimal(-100), [1], [decimal(9)], decimal(-100));
  // fix timestamp
  sig.timestamp = BigNumber.from(await sig.timestamp).add(5);

  // but before liquidation, partyB fullfills partyA close request
  await this.hedger.fillCloseRequest(
    1,
    limitFillCloseRequestBuilder()
      .filledAmount(decimal(50))
      .closedPrice(decimal(9))
      .build(),
  );

  var info = await this.user.getBalanceInfo();
  console.log("after closing: partyA allocated: " + info.allocatedBalances / 1e18 + " locked: " + info.totalLocked/1e18 + " pendingLocked: " + info.totalPendingLocked / 1e18);
  var info = await this.hedger.getBalanceInfo(this.user.getAddress());
  console.log("after closing: partyB allocated: " + info.allocatedBalances / 1e18 + " locked: " + info.totalLocked/1e18 + " pendingLocked: " + info.totalPendingLocked / 1e18);

  // liquidator starts liquidating partyA
  await context.liquidationFacet.connect(this.liquidator.signer).liquidatePartyA(
    this.user.signer.address,
    sig
  );
  await context.liquidationFacet.connect(this.liquidator.signer).setSymbolsPrice(
    this.user.signer.address,
    sig
  );
  await context.liquidationFacet.connect(this.liquidator.signer).liquidatePositionsPartyA(
    this.user.signer.address,
    [1]
  );

  var info = await this.user.getBalanceInfo();
  console.log("after liquidation: partyA allocated: " + info.allocatedBalances / 1e18 + " locked: " + info.totalLocked/1e18 + " pendingLocked: " + info.totalPendingLocked / 1e18);
  var info = await this.hedger.getBalanceInfo(this.user.getAddress());
  console.log("after liquidation: partyB allocated: " + info.allocatedBalances / 1e18 + " locked: " + info.totalLocked/1e18 + " pendingLocked: " + info.totalPendingLocked / 1e18);

});
```

Console execution result:
```js
partyA allocated: 109 locked: 20 pendingLocked: 0
partyB allocated: 1000 locked: 20 pendingLocked: 0
after closing: partyA allocated: 59 locked: 10 pendingLocked: 0
after closing: partyB allocated: 1050 locked: 10 pendingLocked: 0
after liquidation: partyA allocated: 0 locked: 0 pendingLocked: 0
after liquidation: partyB allocated: 1079.5 locked: 0 pendingLocked: 0
liquidator balance: 0
```
As can be noticed, partyA + partyB have 1109 total after closing, but only 1079.5 after liquidation.

If the `fillCloseRequest` is commented out, then liquidation produces correct result:
```js
partyA allocated: 109 locked: 20 pendingLocked: 0
partyB allocated: 1000 locked: 20 pendingLocked: 0
after liquidation: partyA allocated: 0 locked: 0 pendingLocked: 0
after liquidation: partyB allocated: 1106 locked: 0 pendingLocked: 0
liquidator balance: 3
```

## Code Snippet

Notice that there are no nonces of either party in the liquidation signature:

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Include partyA and partyB nonces in the liquidation signature.
